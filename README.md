# 🧠 Live Agentic Intelligence with MCP

Welcome to the official repository for my session on **Live Agentic Intelligence with MCP**.

This session dives into the world of agentic AI — how to build intelligent, multi-agent systems using **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**. We cover everything from fundamentals to real-world deployment, including:

- How to build your own MCP server.
- Differences between **MCP Server** and **FastMCP** abstraction.
- Running and deploying your own MCP server to GitHub for global access.
- Live coding, Python notebooks, and all session resources in one place.

## 🌐 Live Demo Links

Explore the visual and practical comparisons used in the session:

### 🔹 FastMCP vs MCP Server

**Demo Link**: [Build_With_AI](https://goutham-nivass.github.io/Build_With_AI/)

- This comparison shows how **FastMCP** acts as a minimal and efficient abstraction over the full MCP server.
- You’ll see how much cleaner and faster it is to get started while still retaining powerful features.

---

### 🔹 CrewAI vs LangChain vs MCP Comparison

**Demo Link**: [Agentic_MCP_HTML](https://goutham-nivass.github.io/Agentic_MCP_HTML/)

- This shows how different frameworks approach agent orchestration and tool/resource integration.
- Emphasizes how MCP simplifies multi-agent coordination and context sharing.
